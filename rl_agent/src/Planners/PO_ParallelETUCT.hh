/** \file PO_ParallelETUCT.hh
    Defines my real-time model-based RL architecture which uses UCT with eligiblity traces for planning. This version of UCT plans over states augmented with k-action histories.
    The modified version of UCT used is presented in:
    L. Kocsis and C. Szepesv´ari, "Bandit based monte-carlo planning," in
    ECML-06. Number 4212 in LNCS. Springer, 2006, pp. 282-293.
    The real-time architecture is presented in:

It uses a modified version of UCT for planning, which plans on a model using Monte Carlo rollouts. Unlike the original UCT, it does not separate values by tree depth, and it incorporates eligibility traces. This version plans over states augmented with k-action histories, for delayed or partially observable domains. */
